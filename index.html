                <p>Hi &#128526;. It feels strange to have been in a class for a week and not met any of you except for Mark and Storme. I liked the html-css presentations, and I wanted to try some of the cool stuff I saw like media queries and animations. As I'm making a page and need to fill it with text, I thought I'd introduce myself.</p>

                <p>Hi, I'm Bob &#128075;. Before this I worked as plumber/bathroom fitter, but I enjoy working with computers so I thought I'd give the course a shot. I have done some programming in the past, but it was a long time ago at school. In fact, when I last used javascript, 'let's were 'var's, semicolons were mandatory, and you'd check what you made in notepad was compatible with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator" target="_blank">Netscape Navigator</a>. Before coding, I was considering electrical engineering, so a lot of study in my free time in the last year or so has been around programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATmega328" target="_blank">micro-controllers</a> (eg Arduino clones). It's similar to the javascript stuff we are doing (I was learning a language called C). One big difference is you export your program to an external chip, and then you get to send your output data to something physical, such as LEDs, motors, or whatever you've wired to that chip.</p>
    
                <p>Well, I'm not really that interesting I'm afraid &#129393;. That's a shame because I'm trying to fill up some space with text so I can see how my CSS layout works. Perhaps introduce you to my dogs...</p>

                <h2>Chips and Pepper</h2>

                </a>

                <p>Here we have my dogs, Mr Chips and Miss Pepper. They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_White_Terrier" target="_blank">westies</a>. Chips is the eldest by one year, and he has his younger sister Pepper to keep him company. They have very different personalities, with Chips being quite slothful and chilled out, and Pepper being energetic and hyperactive.</p>

                <p>Chips (Kennel Club name Manakel Star Gazer) is inquisitive and social around other dogs. However, when he is at home, he enjoys his naps and grumbles when he is disturbed. One day, I left a chow mein unattended and Chips ate the whole thing.</p>

                <p>Pepper (Kennel Club name Star Of Surprise) is full of energy, and she really enjoys dashing and paddling. She is the self-appointed garden warden, and she will sit at the patio door and guard against cats and pigeons. Unfortunately, she likes to steal dirty socks and hide them. To tire Pepper out in the evening, I put on gardening gloves and let her latch on and wrestle like a police dog.</p>

                <p>Both dogs are good at tricks, but unless you have a treat for them, they won't perform. They seem to be happy I've been home this week because they get an extra lunchtime walk.</p>
